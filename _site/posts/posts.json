In doing so, the visualisation fails to portray the severity of the different armed conflict events, which can be measured by number of fatalities in each event.\r\n\r\n\r\nScale the size of each point by the number of fatalities. This allows the viewer to visualize the severity of each event.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the y-axis label of Armed Conflict Event by Type, ‘Count of Sheet1’ does not provide any meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nRename to ‘Count of Event’\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nx-axis label of Armed Conflict Event by Type is shown as ‘Event Date’. This is misleading since it is merely Event Year.\r\n\r\n\r\nChange to ‘Event Year’\r\n\r\n\r\nAesthetics\r\n\r\n\r\ns/n\r\n\r\n\r\nComment\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestion\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the y-axis of Armed Conflict Event by Type, the data tends to extend beyond the y-axis tick labels’ upper and lower bounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep the data points within the upper and lower bounds of the y-axis tick labels’ upper and lower bounds\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the x-axis tick label of Armed Conflict Event by Type, the final tick label ‘2020’ is chopped off. This is aesthetically unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdjust for all tick labels to be visible and none chopped off.’\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Armed Conflict Event by Type visualization, the height of the visualisation is quite high and all 6 component charts use the same x-axis at the bottom. As it is, it is hard to match the points to the x-axis especially for the component charts at the top such as for Event Type ‘Battles’.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd in Gridlines to allow for easy visual matching of points to x-axis.\r\n\r\n\r\nInteractivity\r\n\r\n\r\ns/n\r\n\r\n\r\nComment\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestion\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is limited interactivity for the filtering of country. The given visualization only allows for Single Value filtering of country. This disallows the viewer from visually comparing 2 countries by selecting 2 of them at one go, for example.\r\n\r\n\r\nAllow for Multiple Value Selection for Country\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no interactivity option for filtering based on Event Type. For example, if viewer is only interested in viewing Battles in Myanmar, he/she is unable to do so and instead has to view all Event Types.\r\n\r\n\r\nAllow for filtering of Event Type\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It can be reproduced by merely changing the way the latter chart is presented.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo away with the ‘% of strongly agreed to vaccination’ chart as it does not concern anything new on top of the first chart.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nContinuing from comment 2) above, it also isn’t obvious from the titles of both charts whether they are referring to the same survey question. The chart on the left has the title ‘Which country is more pro-vaccine’ while the chart on the right has the title ‘% of strongly agreed to vaccination’. On inspection and comparison of the bars, it is apparent that they are visualizations of the same question, but the titles alone are not clear about that.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf 2 charts are referring to the same survey question, their charts should be clear about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visualization only shows the responses by proportion of the countries’ respondents but does not provide insight into the absolute number of respondents. If the sample size for a particular country is small, then the results for that country may not be properly representative.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will help to add information on the absolute number of respondents and possibly add statistical measures like error bars.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nLegend does not explain explicitly what responses 2, 3, 4 represent.\r\n\r\n\r\nLabel 2 as Slightly Agree, 3 as Neutral, 4 as Slightly Disagree\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\nx-axis labelling unclear. For example, ‘% of Total Record’ is unclear and could mean % of all respondents to someone who doesn’t know the background of the data.\r\n\r\n\r\nRename ‘% of Total Record’ as ‘% of each country’s respondents’.\r\n\r\n\r\nAesthetics\r\n\r\n\r\ns/n\r\n\r\n\r\nComment\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestion\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nFor ‘Which country is more pro-vaccine?’ chart, the responses are portrayed as ‘5’ on the left to ‘1’ on the right. This is the inverse way in which the legend is portrayed, which isn’t the most visually intuitive.\r\n\r\n\r\nPortray the responses as 1 on the left to 5 on the right.\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\nThe x-axis of the left chart is in whole numbers while the x-axis of the right chart is to 1 decimal place. There is no need for there to be 1 decimal place precision as the x-axis intervals are already so wide.\r\n\r\n\r\nMake both x-axis of the same whole number precision.\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is aesthetically odd for the ‘united kingdom’ bar to go beyond the maximum value of the x-axis.\r\n\r\n\r\nMake all of the chart values to stay within the maximum bound of axes.\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n\r\nIf x-axis already shows units is %, no need to label each tick with %.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemove % from the x-axis tick marks.\r\n\r\n\r\nb)\r\nSketch of proposed design\r\n\r\nAdvantages of proposed design\r\n\r\n\r\ns/n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantage\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Likert Scale is good to visualize attitude or belief items such as the willingness to receive the COvID19 vaccine in this study. By centering around 0, it is visually intuitive at one glance to see if respondents of a country lean more towards agreeing or disagreeing.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nBy allowing for filtering of different profiles such as gender, age group, household size bracket etc, the user is able to derive more pointed insights rather than a static view of the entire population\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nBy showing the Error Bars in the Dot Plot, one is able to be visually informed how certain one can be of the study results based on the data of each group of respondents. It provides visual information regarding the variability of the data and is useful as predictors of the range of new samples.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nAllowing for the user to select from a list of questions regarding public perception of the vaccine in different contexts allows for a variety of insights regarding the issue, rather than just from one perspective as provided in the original visualization.\r\n\r\n\r\nc)\r\nClick for link to Tableau Public post\r\nd)\r\nFor this makeover, the visualization comes in the form of 2 charts: 1) Likert Scale and 2) Dot Plot with Error Bars.\r\nWe go through the Data Source Preparation steps first before going through the steps to build the 2 charts proper.\r\nData Source Preparation\r\nDownload the data for the relevant countries from https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker/tree/master/data\r\nOpen ‘australia.csv’ as the first Data Source.\r\nRemove it as shown in the screengrab below.\r\n\r\nFig 1: Remove australia.csv\r\nCreate a New Union comprising the 14 tables for the 14 countries\r\n\r\nFig 2: New Union to join 14 country tables\r\nCreate new aliases for the countries under ‘Table Name’ field.\r\n\r\nFig 3: Create new aliases for countries\r\nRename ‘Table Name’ field to ‘Country’.\r\nCreate aliases for all the survey questions’ responses (vac_1, vac_2, vac2_1, vac2_2, vac2_3, vac2_6, vac_3) as shown below. This is to facilitate building calculated Field later on where there is inequality in the formula based on the survey responses.\r\n\r\nFig 4: Create aliases for responses\r\nInspect the data. On inspection, it seems that the Sweden does not have any data under the union as the ‘RecordNo’ field which all the other files are joined under is saved as ‘record’ instead. Rectify this in the raw ‘sweden.csv’ file and redo the union, checking that this is fixed and Sweden data is successfully joined this time.\r\n\r\nFig 5: sweden.csv unable to join\r\nCreating new parameters and fields to build the Likert Scale\r\nHide the unneeded fields from the data which we will not be using for the visualization. We retain the following fields:\r\n\r\nFig 6: Hide unneeded fields\r\nCreate new Calculated Field called ‘Age Group’ as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 7: Create new calculated field ‘Age Group’\r\nThe ages are binned accordingly so that viewers can view results by meaningful distinct age groups.\r\nCreate new Calculated Field called ‘Household Size Bracket’ as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 8: Create new calculated field ‘Household Size Bracket’\r\nThe household sizes are binned accordingly so that viewers can view results by meaningful household size brackets\r\nCreate new Calculated Field called ‘Number of Children’ as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 9: Create new calculated field ‘Number of Children’\r\nThe number of children in each household is binned accordingly so that viewers can view results by meaningful brackets of the number of children in each household.\r\nCreate a new Parameter called ‘Select Question’. This is in view of creating a Dropdown Filter for the viewer to select the relevant question he/she would like to view the visualization results for.\r\n\r\nFig 10: Create new parameter ‘Select Question’\r\nCreate Calculated Field called vac1_reversescore as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 11: Create new calculated field ‘vac1_reversescore’\r\nThis reverses the order of the scores where 5-Strongly Disagree now has a score of 1, while 1-Strongly Agree has a score of 5. This is for the construction of the Likert Scale where responses below 3 (Neutral) are for negative responses. Create the same fields for all the other survey questions (vac_2, vac2_1, vac2_2, vac2_3, vac2_6, vac_3).\r\nMake sure to label in the Response Legend that 1 corresponds to Strongly Disagree, 2 to Disagree, 3 to Neutral, 4 to Agree and 5 as Strongly Agree.\r\nCreate new Calculated Field called ‘Selected Question’ as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 12: Create new calculated field ‘Selected Question’\r\nCreate Calculated Field called ‘Number of Records’ =1 as follows: This is used as a dummy to add up Number of Records.\r\n\r\nFig 13: Create new calculated field ‘Number of Records’\r\nCreate Calculated Field called ‘Total Count’ as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 14: Create new calculated field ‘Total Count’\r\nCreate Calculated Field called ‘Count Negative’ as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 15: Create new calculated field ‘Count Negative’\r\nCreate Calculated Field called ‘Total Count Negative’ as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 16: Create new calculated field ‘Total Count Negative’\r\nCreate Calculated Field called ‘Percentage’ as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 17: Create new calculated field ‘Percentage’\r\nCreate calculated Field called ‘Gantt Start’ as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 18: Create new calculated field ’Gantt Start\r\nCreate Calculated Field called ‘Gantt Percent’ as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 19: Create new calculated field ‘Gantt Percent’\r\nBuilding the Likert Scale\r\nDrag Gantt Percent to Columns\r\nDrag Country to Rows. Chart will first look as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag Response to Detail under the Marks tab\r\nUnder Gantt Percent, select Compute using Response as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChange Chart Type to Gantt Bar under Marks\r\nDrag Response to Colour under the Marks tab\r\nDrag Percentage to Size under the Marks tab. Chart will now look as follows:\r\nDrag Score into Filters tab and uncheck Null so Null responses are disregarded throughout.\r\n\r\nFig 20: Uncheck Null\r\nShow the Parameter ‘Select Question’. This shows up as a Dropdown Bar.\r\nChange the Chart Title to be dynamic according to the question selected as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 21: Make chart title dynamic\r\nDrag Age Group into Filters tab:\r\n\r\nFig 22: Filter age group\r\nShow Age Group as a Multiple Values Dropdown list\r\nDrag ‘gender’ into Filters tab:\r\n\r\nFig 23: Filter gender\r\nShow gender as a Multiple values list\r\nDrag employment_status into Filters tab:\r\n\r\nFig 24: Filter employment status\r\nInclude Null as an allowed value although it accounts for an insignificant number of responses. User can uncheck it to phase it out if desired.\r\nShow employment_status as a Multiple Values Dropdown list\r\nDrag ‘Household Size Bracket’ into Filters tab:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow Household Size Bracket as a Multiple Values Dropdown list\r\nDrag ‘Number of Children’ into Filters tab:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow Number of Children as a Multiple Values Dropdown list\r\nLikert Scale is as follows, before any formatting:\r\n\r\nFig 25: First look of Likert Scale\r\nCreating new parameters and fields to build the Dot Plot with Error Bars\r\nWe next build Dot Plot with Error Bars. For each set of filters selected by the user, this Dot Plot will show the Proportion of Respondents from each Country with a ‘Strongly Agree’ response, accompanied by Error Bars showing the 95% Confidence Intervals. This is an improvement from the original ‘% of strongly agreed to vaccination’ chart, as it not only allows for filtering of profiles but also shows the confidence intervals based on the sample size of each country.\r\nCreate Calculated Field called Strongly Agree Count as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 26: Create calculated field ‘Strongly Agree Count’\r\nThis is to mark each Strongly Agree response as 1 count. Create the same fields for the other 4 responses.\r\nCreate Calculated Field called ‘Proportion of Respondents_Strongly Agree’ as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 27: Create calculated field ’Proportion of respondents _Strongly Agree’\r\nThis is to count the proportion of respondents which selected Strongly Agree out of the total number of records. Create the same fields for the other 4 responses.\r\nCreate Calculated Field called ‘Proportion Standard Error_Strongly Agree’ as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 28: Create calculated field ‘Proportion Standard Error_Strongly Agree’\r\nThis is to calculate the standard error. Create the same fields for the other 4 responses.\r\nCreate Calculated Field called Z_95% as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 29: Create calculated field Z_95%\r\nThis is the critical z-score for 95% confidence level\r\nCreate Calculated Field called ’Upper 95%_Strongly Agree’ as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 30: create calculated field ’Upper 95%_Strongly Agree’\r\nThis is to calculate the upper 95% confidence level for the proportion of respondents who answered Strongly Agree. Create the same fields for the other 4 responses.\r\nCreate Calculated Field called ’Lower 95%_Strongly Agree’ as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 31: Create calculated field ’Lower 95%_Strongly Agree’\r\nThis is to calculate the lower 95% confidence level for the proportion of respondents who answered Strongly Agree. Create the same fields for the other 4 responses.\r\nCreate Calculated Field ‘Lower 95% Level’ as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 32: Created calculated field ‘Lower 95% Level’\r\nThis is to generate the correct lower 95% level according to the type of response which the user wishes to see the lower 95% level for.\r\nCreate Calculated Field ‘Upper 95% Level’ as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 33; Create calculated field ‘Upper 95% Level’\r\nThis is to generate the correct upper 95% level according to the type of response which the user wishes to see the upper 95% level for.\r\nCreate Parameter ‘Select Type of Response’. This is to select the type of response for which we wish to see the Dot Plot with Error Bars for.\r\n\r\nFig 34: create parameter ‘Select Type of Response’\r\nCreate Calculated Field called ‘Select Response Type’. This is to display the correct proportion of respondents’ responses for the response type which the user selects in step 7 above.\r\n\r\nFig 35: Create calculated field ‘Select Response Type’\r\nBuilding the Dot Plot with Error Bars\r\nDrag ‘Select Response Type’ to Columns\r\nDrag Country to Rows\r\nChange Marks type to Circle. At this point chart looks as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 36: First look of Dot Plot\r\nDrag Measure values to the ‘top x-axis’ and then exclude everything except the Upper 95% Level and Lower 95% Level\r\n\r\nClick on Measure values in the Marks tab and change Marks type to Line. This generates a squiggly line across the chart as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 37: Change marks type to Line\r\n\r\nFig 38: Chart looks like a squiggly line initially\r\nDrag Measure Names to Path to generate the line which represents the 95% confidence interval.\r\n\r\nFig 39: Drag Measure Names to Path\r\nRight click x-axis and click Synchronize Axis\r\n\r\nFig 40: Synchronize Axis\r\nFormat the colour of the Dot to make it different from the colour of the Error Bars\r\nCompile both Likert Scale and Dot Plot with Error Bars into a single dashboard for integration and incorporate user-friendly interface\r\nCreate a new Dashboard\r\nDrag sheets ‘Likert’ and ‘Final Error Bars’ into the dashboard side by side. It will look as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo synchronize the order of the countries on both charts, go to the Likert sheet, right click on the y-axis and select Sort. Sort by Field, where the Field Name is ‘Select Response type’ in Ascending order. For example, if user selects to view the Dot Plot for ‘1 - Strongly Disagree’, both charts will be sorted with the country on the top having the least proportion of ‘Strongly Disagree’ and the country on the bottom having the highest proportion of ‘Strongly Disagree’.\r\n\r\nFig 41: Sort order of countries by select Response Type field\r\nMove the Select Question dropdown list to the top. This is so that the entire question can be shown and not truncated.\r\nMove the select ‘Type of Response’ dropdown list below ‘Select Question’\r\nDrag all the profile filters (gender, Age group, Household Size Bracket, Number of children and employment status) to the bottom of the dashboard.\r\nCreate a text box to direct the user to filter to view results based on different profile combinations.\r\n\r\nFig 42: Create text box to direct user to filter by profiles\r\nCapitalize first letter of each profile filter group to tidy the look.\r\ngo to the Final Error Bars sheet. To show the number of records for each country for that particular question, drag ‘Number of Records’ into the All tab under Marks as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen edit the tooltip under the same All tab as above:\r\n\r\nFig 43: Edit tooltip\r\nChange the title for the Dot Plot chart to as follows:\r\n\r\nFig 44: Change title for Dot Plot Chart\r\nAdd Dashboard Title ‘A study to understand the willingness and perception of receiving the COVID19 vaccine across different countries’\r\nFinal product:\r\n\r\nFig 45: Final Look of Dashboard\r\ne)\r\nThree major observations revealed by the data visualisation prepared\r\nWhen asked if they would get the vaccine if it becomes available in 2021, France is the country most against it with 34% of respondents indicating they strongly disagree. On the other hand, South Koreans are least against it, with only 6% indicating they strongly disagree. It is also interesting that the 3 countries with least proportion of ‘Strongly Disagree’ are Asian countries, whereas the top 3 countries with highest proportion of ‘Strongly Disagree’ are all Western countries. This could be due to cultural perceptions of vaccines.\r\n\r\nFig 46: Comparing countries’ proportion of residents who Strongly Disagree to receiving COVID19 vaccine in 2021\r\nFemales are significantly more worried than males about the potential side effects of a vaccine. Taking 30% as a reference point, in 11 out of the 14 countries, more than 30% of females indicated strongly agree. On the contrary, only in 2 out of the 14 countries did more than 30% of males indicate strongly agree.\r\nThis is in line with scientific evidence that females are generally more risk-averse than males.\r\n\r\nFig 47: In 11 out of 14 countries, more than 30% of Females strongly agree that they are worried about potential side effects of the vaccine\r\n\r\nFig 48: In only 3 out of 14 countries, more than 30% of Males strongly agree that they are worried about potential side effects of the vaccine\r\nGenerally the elderly are more worried than the young about getting COVID19. Taking the elderly as those of above 60 years old, and the young as those up to 30 years old. Using 20% as a reference point, in 11 out of 14 countries, more than 20% of the elderly indicated strongly agreed that they are worried about getting COVID19. On the contrary, only in 4 out of the 14 countries did more than 20% of youth strongly agreed that they are worried about getting COVID19.\r\nThis is probably due to the fact that there has been published statistical evidence that the elderly are more susceptible to being more adversely affected and have a higher death rate when hit by COVID19 as compared to the young, who have a much higher and faster recovery rate.\r\n\r\nFig 49: In 11 out of 14 countries, more than 20% of the elderly (aged above 60) strongly agree they are worried of getting COVID19\r\n\r\nFig 50: In only 4 out of 14 countries do more than 20% of youth (aged up to 30) strongly agree they are worried of getting COviD19\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Overview\r\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coeficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\r\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coeficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\r\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\r\nTo reveal the relationship between highdimensional variables pairwisely.\r\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\r\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\r\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\r\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\r\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R. .\r\n2.0 Installing and Launching R Packages\r\nBefore you get started, you are required:\r\nto start a new R project, and\r\nto create a new R Markdown document.\r\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\r\n\r\n\r\npackages = c('ggpubr', 'tidyverse')\r\n\r\nfor(p in packages){library\r\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\r\n    install.packages(p)\r\n  }\r\n  library(p, character.only = T)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Importing and Preparing The Data Set\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\n\r\n\r\nwine <- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code chunks used to create the data visualisation consists of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.\r\n\r\n\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `fixed acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nva <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `volatile acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `citric acid`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nrs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `residual sugar`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `chlorides`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nfSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `free sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ntSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `total sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ndensity <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\npH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nsulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nalcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, the ggarrange function of ggpur package is used to group these histograms together.\r\n\r\n\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, \r\n          ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It says ‘Resident labour force by age’ followed by ‘Per Cent’ at the bottom, which doesn’t really help in readers’ understanding.\r\nSuggestion: Title should mention the distinct time periods that the chart is describing. Change the title to ‘Comparison of resident labour force percentage by age groups from June 2009 to June 2019’.\r\nMismatch between statement and visualization:\r\nComment: The statement mentions LFPR increasing but there is no illustration or reference to LFPR in the visualisation. This serves to confuse readers since they may be wondering whether the visualisation is referring to LFPR or just resident labour force.\r\nSuggestion: Have a separate visualisation to reference how LFPR has increased from 2009 to 2019 for the various age groups.\r\nChart describes something that isn’t visually represented, causing potential confusion:\r\nComment: The statement mentions ‘the share of the resident labour force aged 25 to 54 declined from 75% to 67%’, but there is no visualization of this at all. This creates a disconnect between the statement and visualization.\r\nSuggestion: Bin the age groups and have 1 of them be ‘25-54’ to show this drop from 75% to 67%.\r\nAesthetic\r\nPoor Choice of Colours\r\nComment: The 2 colours used for 2009 and 2019 are both relatively dark and thus no visual contrast.\r\nSuggestion: Use 2 more contrasting colours to make the distinction between both years more obvious.\r\nRepetitive Labelling\r\nComment: The labelling for this graph is rather repetitive. For example, you see “June 2009” show up 3 times; 1) in the table below 2) ‘Median Age in June 2009’ at the median line 3) Labelling the line graph. Similar for “June 2019”. This makes the graph look cluttered.\r\nSuggestion: Only have one Date label for each date rather than multiple labels for the same date.\r\nNo vertical axis\r\nComment: It is not clear at first sight what the height of the line graph represents.\r\nSuggestion: Have a vertical axis on the side of the graph to show that the points on the lines stand for percentage\r\nx-axis not labelled\r\nComment: Not everyone will immediately know that ’15-19’, ’20-24’ etc represents age groups.\r\nSuggestion: Label the axis with ‘Age Group’\r\nb)\r\nWe make use of 2 charts to improve the current design and better bring out the message of the statement.\r\nFirst Chart: Comparison of resident labour force percentage by age groups from June 2009 to June 2019\r\n\r\nBy binning the age groups and showing the group 25-54 specifically, viewers can now immediately visualize how the percentage of 25-54 dropped from 75% in 2009 to 67% in 2019 over the years. By switching from line chart to bar chart, categorical data of age groups is more correctly represented.\r\nBy having a y-axis showing ‘Percentage of Workforce’ and labelling the bars, viewers are able to know what the heights of the bars represent. This is opposed to the current design where there is no immediate understanding visually of what the lines represent.\r\nSecond Chart: Showing the increase in Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) from 2009 to 2019 for all age groups\r\n\r\nJuxtaposing the first and second chart side by side will allow viewer to visualize what is said in the statement, that despite LFPR increasing for age group 25-54, the share of the resident labour force declined from 75% to 67%.\r\nThe chart shows LFPR actually increased for all age groups from 2009 to 2019. So, the decline from 75% to 67% could also be explained by the fact that the LFPR for other age groups increased more than that of 25-54.\r\nc)\r\nClick for link to Tableau Public post\r\nd)\r\nStep-by-step description on how first chart was prepared\r\nUsing Table 7, bin the age groups into ‘15-24’, ‘25-54’ and ‘55 & Over’. Calculate the age groups’ percentage of labour force for each year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 7\r\nLoad dataset into Tableau. Double check that data and datatypes are correct before proceeding to make visualization.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag ‘Age Group’ into Columns. Drag ‘2009’ into Rows. Under ‘Show Me’, select Stacked Bar type\r\n\r\n\r\nSelect all of 2010-2019 and drag them into the 2009 axis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChange the name of axis to ‘Percentage of Resident Labour Force (%)’\r\nShow Labels to label each shaded area with the corresponding %.\r\nChange title to ’Comparison of resident labour force percentage by age groups in June 2009 and June 2019.\r\nAnnotate the Median Age in both 2009 and 2019 with Point\r\nFinal product:\r\n\r\n\r\nStep-by-step description on how second chart was prepared\r\nUsing Table 5, extract the data for age groups ‘15-24’, ‘25-54’, ‘55-64’, ‘65 & Over’\r\nLoad dataset into Tableau. Double check that data and datatypes are correct before proceeding to make visualization.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag ‘Age group’ into Columns. Drag ‘2009’ into Rows. Select Line chart.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag 2010 to 2019 into ‘Measure Values’ and remove ‘Age Group’ from Columns\r\n\r\n\r\nChange y-axis Title to LFPR (%)\r\nLabel the values for only 2009 and 2019 for all age groups\r\nChange title to ‘Increase in Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) from 2009 to 2019 for all age groups’\r\nAdjust the sequence of the legend according to the sequence the age groups appear in the chart\r\nAdjust y-axis max value to 100\r\nFinal Product:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPutting everything into a dashboard\r\nCreate a new dashboard\r\nDrag ‘Labour Force Pct’ (first chart) to the left side and drag ‘LFPR’ (second chart) to the right side\r\nAdd a textbox at the top and type in some key observations from the visualizations\r\nFinal product:\r\n\r\n\r\ne)\r\nThree major observations revealed by the data visualisation prepared\r\nLFPR actually increased broadly across all age groups of the population.\r\nThe share of the labour force aged 25-54 steadily declined over each year from 2009 to 2019, while that aged 55 & over steadily increased each year from 2009 to 2019, with only the exception from 2014 to 2015.\r\nThe increase in LFPR from 2009 to 2019 was sharpest for age group 65 & over, increasing 11.5 percentage points from 17.2% to 28.7%. The increase in LFPR from 2009 to 2019 was gentlest for age group 25-54, increasing only 3.8 percentage points from 84.5% to 88.3%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
