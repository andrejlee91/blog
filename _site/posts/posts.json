The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coeficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\r\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coeficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\r\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\r\nTo reveal the relationship between highdimensional variables pairwisely.\r\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\r\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\r\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\r\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\r\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R. .\r\n2.0 Installing and Launching R Packages\r\nBefore you get started, you are required:\r\nto start a new R project, and\r\nto create a new R Markdown document.\r\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\r\n\r\n\r\npackages = c('ggpubr', 'tidyverse')\r\n\r\nfor(p in packages){library\r\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\r\n    install.packages(p)\r\n  }\r\n  library(p, character.only = T)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Importing and Preparing The Data Set\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\n\r\n\r\nwine <- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code chunks used to create the data visualisation consists of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.\r\n\r\n\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `fixed acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nva <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `volatile acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `citric acid`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nrs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `residual sugar`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `chlorides`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nfSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `free sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ntSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `total sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ndensity <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\npH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nsulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nalcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, the ggarrange function of ggpur package is used to group these histograms together.\r\n\r\n\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, \r\n          ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It says ‘Resident labour force by age’ followed by ‘Per Cent’ at the bottom, which doesn’t really help in readers’ understanding.\r\nSuggestion: Title should mention the distinct time periods that the chart is describing. Change the title to ‘Comparison of resident labour force percentage by age groups from June 2009 to June 2019’.\r\nMismatch between statement and visualization:\r\nComment: The statement mentions LFPR increasing but there is no illustration or reference to LFPR in the visualisation. This serves to confuse readers since they may be wondering whether the visualisation is referring to LFPR or just resident labour force.\r\nSuggestion: Have a separate visualisation to reference how LFPR has increased from 2009 to 2019 for the various age groups.\r\nChart describes something that isn’t visually represented, causing potential confusion:\r\nComment: The statement mentions ‘the share of the resident labour force aged 25 to 54 declined from 75% to 67%’, but there is no visualization of this at all. This creates a disconnect between the statement and visualization.\r\nSuggestion: Bin the age groups and have 1 of them be ‘25-54’ to show this drop from 75% to 67%.\r\nAesthetic\r\nPoor Choice of Colours\r\nComment: The 2 colours used for 2009 and 2019 are both relatively dark and thus no visual contrast.\r\nSuggestion: Use 2 more contrasting colours to make the distinction between both years more obvious.\r\nRepetitive Labelling\r\nComment: The labelling for this graph is rather repetitive. For example, you see “June 2009” show up 3 times; 1) in the table below 2) ‘Median Age in June 2009’ at the median line 3) Labelling the line graph. Similar for “June 2019”. This makes the graph look cluttered.\r\nSuggestion: Only have one Date label for each date rather than multiple labels for the same date.\r\nNo vertical axis\r\nComment: It is not clear at first sight what the height of the line graph represents.\r\nSuggestion: Have a vertical axis on the side of the graph to show that the points on the lines stand for percentage\r\nx-axis not labelled\r\nComment: Not everyone will immediately know that ’15-19’, ’20-24’ etc represents age groups.\r\nSuggestion: Label the axis with ‘Age Group’\r\nb)\r\nWe make use of 2 charts to improve the current design and better bring out the message of the statement.\r\nFirst Chart: Comparison of resident labour force percentage by age groups from June 2009 to June 2019\r\n\r\nBy binning the age groups and showing the group 25-54 specifically, viewers can now immediately visualize how the percentage of 25-54 dropped from 75% in 2009 to 67% in 2019 over the years. By switching from line chart to bar chart, categorical data of age groups is more correctly represented.\r\nBy having a y-axis showing ‘Percentage of Workforce’ and labelling the bars, viewers are able to know what the heights of the bars represent. This is opposed to the current design where there is no immediate understanding visually of what the lines represent.\r\nSecond Chart: Showing the increase in Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) from 2009 to 2019 for all age groups\r\n\r\nJuxtaposing the first and second chart side by side will allow viewer to visualize what is said in the statement, that despite LFPR increasing for age group 25-54, the share of the resident labour force declined from 75% to 67%.\r\nThe chart shows LFPR actually increased for all age groups from 2009 to 2019. So, the decline from 75% to 67% could also be explained by the fact that the LFPR for other age groups increased more than that of 25-54.\r\nc)\r\nClick for link to Tableau Public post\r\nd)\r\nStep-by-step description on how first chart was prepared\r\nUsing Table 7, bin the age groups into ‘15-24’, ‘25-54’ and ‘55 & Over’. Calculate the age groups’ percentage of labour force for each year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 7\r\nLoad dataset into Tableau. Double check that data and datatypes are correct before proceeding to make visualization.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag ‘Age Group’ into Columns. Drag ‘2009’ into Rows. Under ‘Show Me’, select Stacked Bar type\r\n\r\n\r\nSelect all of 2010-2019 and drag them into the 2009 axis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChange the name of axis to ‘Percentage of Resident Labour Force (%)’\r\nShow Labels to label each shaded area with the corresponding %.\r\nChange title to ’Comparison of resident labour force percentage by age groups in June 2009 and June 2019.\r\nAnnotate the Median Age in both 2009 and 2019 with Point\r\nFinal product:\r\n\r\n\r\nStep-by-step description on how second chart was prepared\r\nUsing Table 5, extract the data for age groups ‘15-24’, ‘25-54’, ‘55-64’, ‘65 & Over’\r\nLoad dataset into Tableau. Double check that data and datatypes are correct before proceeding to make visualization.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag ‘Age group’ into Columns. Drag ‘2009’ into Rows. Select Line chart.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag 2010 to 2019 into ‘Measure Values’ and remove ‘Age Group’ from Columns\r\n\r\n\r\nChange y-axis Title to LFPR (%)\r\nLabel the values for only 2009 and 2019 for all age groups\r\nChange title to ‘Increase in Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) from 2009 to 2019 for all age groups’\r\nAdjust the sequence of the legend according to the sequence the age groups appear in the chart\r\nAdjust y-axis max value to 100\r\nFinal Product:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPutting everything into a dashboard\r\nCreate a new dashboard\r\nDrag ‘Labour Force Pct’ (first chart) to the left side and drag ‘LFPR’ (second chart) to the right side\r\nAdd a textbox at the top and type in some key observations from the visualizations\r\nFinal product:\r\n\r\n\r\ne)\r\nThree major observations revealed by the data visualisation prepared\r\nLFPR actually increased broadly across all age groups of the population.\r\nThe share of the labour force aged 25-54 steadily declined over each year from 2009 to 2019, while that aged 55 & over steadily increased each year from 2009 to 2019, with only the exception from 2014 to 2015.\r\nThe increase in LFPR from 2009 to 2019 was sharpest for age group 65 & over, increasing 11.5 percentage points from 17.2% to 28.7%. The increase in LFPR from 2009 to 2019 was gentlest for age group 25-54, increasing only 3.8 percentage points from 84.5% to 88.3%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
